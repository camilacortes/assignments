        <p class="about-paragraph">Plant Hospital was created in hopes of reviving or taking care of plants who need more attention. We understand that day to day life can sometimes get busy. Wether you're going on a vacation, work event, etc. We have you covered with professionals to help look after your plant needs. We require that you send an email to our plant hospital coodinator with basic information of your plant, if there is anything wrong with it, or the reason that you are requiring your plant to be watched. Please note that you do not need to be laving out of town. Sometimes a professional can help just revive your plant or get them the nutrients it needs. </p>
