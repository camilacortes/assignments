        <p class="about-paragraph">Plant Hospital was created in hopes of reviving or taking care of plants who need more attention. We understand that day to day life can sometimes get busy. Wether you're going on a vacation, work event, etc. We have you covered with professionals to help look after your plant needs. We require that you send an email to our plant hospital coodinator with basic information of your plant, if there is anything wrong with it, or the reason that you are requiring your plant to be watched. Please note that you do not need to be going out of town. Sometimes a professional can help just revive your plant or get them the nutrients it needs. </p>

        Succulents require a lot of light so make sure they are placed somehwere with direct sunlight and rotate them everyday so the plant gets distributed with sunlight evenly. Water your plant every 14 days. A good general idea of when to water is by placing your finger into the soil. If the soil is completely dry and it's been about 14 days, go ahead and water your plant's soil. If the soil is moist, wait for the soil to completey dry out. </li>
        <li class="succulent-li">Succulents live in a dry enviorment, the desert usually therefore they don't get water regugarly like other plants do. </li>
        <li class="succulent-li">Potting your succulent is fairly simple. Just make sure that there are drainge holes on the pot so that the plant has a good drainge system.</li>

         </li>
         <li class="house-plants-li">
           Watering: House plants do reqiure more watering. The soil should be moist after watering. Most plants require watering 1-2x a week. Check the soil like you would with succulent plants. 
         </li>
         <li class="house-plants-li">
           Light: Most house plants do just fine with moderate light. Open up your windows and let the sun shine inside your home. Be wary of placing your plants right next to a window because they might burn.
